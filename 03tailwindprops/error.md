# Tailwind v4 + PostCSS Fix Guide

## Problem  
When running a Vite + React + Tailwind v4 project, you may see this error:

[plugin:vite:css] [postcss] It looks like you're trying to use tailwindcss directly as a PostCSS plugin.
The PostCSS plugin has moved to a separate package, so to continue using Tailwind CSS with PostCSS
you'll need to install @tailwindcss/postcss and update your PostCSS configuration.

# Solution Code  

## Step 1: Install the correct PostCSS plugin

```bash
npm install -D @tailwindcss/postcss
```
## Step 2: Update postcss.config.js
```bash
Old way (❌ wrong in Tailwind v4)
js
Copy code
export default {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
New way (✅ correct for Tailwind v4)
js
Copy code
export default {
  plugins: {
    "@tailwindcss/postcss": {},
  },
}
```
## Step 3: Update your CSS entry file (index.css)

```bash
Old (❌ Tailwind v3 style)
css
Copy code
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
New (✅ Tailwind v4 style)
css
Copy code
@import "tailwindcss";
```
# ✅ Final Notes
After these changes, Vite should build without errors.

Tailwind v4 will work properly with your React project.

⚡ Key Difference
Tailwind v3 → used tailwindcss directly as PostCSS plugin

Tailwind v4 → requires @tailwindcss/postcss
